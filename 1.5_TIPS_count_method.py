# Tip
# In the previous video we used help() and dir() inside an interactive Python shell:
#
# >>> dir(str)
#
# Please note that if you want to get the output of help and dir from a normal .py file, you have to use a print
# function, otherwise the .py file will not return any output when executed:
#
# print(dir(str))
#
# That is because the Python interactive shell uses a print function implicitly, so you don't have to type it in,
# but this is not the case when the code is inside .py files.
#
# You should also use a print function when you are coding in the Udemy exercise interface.

y = "salamalakaras"
x = "skoulikomirmigkotripaskouliki"

print(y.count("a"))
print(x.count("i"))
